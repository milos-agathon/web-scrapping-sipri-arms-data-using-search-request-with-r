# Web scrapping SIPRI arms data using search request with R

In this tutorial, we'll analyze American arms transfer to Europe in the last 5 years using the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research’s (SIPRI). SIPRI measures arms transfers as the number of weapon systems or subsystems delivered/produced in a given year to the country’s government under contract, including small arms, tanks, artillery, anti-missile systems, satellites and warplanes.

Using this repo, you'll be able to send a POST request to retrieve data, format and map using non-contiguous cartogram.
